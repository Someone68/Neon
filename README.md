### AAAAAND if you want to fork it, it's very easy to do!

- Honestly the only things you really need are physics settings and levels
- To add levels, just copy paste one of the arrays inside of the arrays in ./game/main.js
- Here's a nice chart to show you what each char does:

| **SYMBOL** | **DESCRIPTION**                                                       |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `x`        | Wall                                                                  |
| `!`        | Lava                                                                  |
| `o`        | Coin                                                                  |
| `@`        | Spawn Point (if there are multiple, it will create that much players) |
